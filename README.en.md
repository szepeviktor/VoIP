‚ò¢Ô∏è Telephony without microwaves

### Motivation

1. Mobile phones have a microwave transmitter with a range of 10 km
2. The computer can handle telephony (copy-paste, `tel:` URLs)
3. With microphones in [webcams](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams.html)
   and external speakers, you can free your hands and even walk away a few meters
